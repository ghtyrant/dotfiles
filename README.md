dotfiles
--------

Simple dotfiles management.

Just clone this repository, put your dotfiles and -folders into ./files (without leading dots) and run ./dotfiles.sh -i to create symlinks.

If you wish to remove your links again, just run ./dotfiles -u.

This tool will never overwrite existing files.
